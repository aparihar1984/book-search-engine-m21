Module 21 MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

## Introduction

For this assignment, I attempted to refactor a functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API into one featuring GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.  This app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## References

To complete this assignment I studied the following activities from the Module 21-MERN Class Activity Files as references:

"01-Ins_Apollo-Server"

"03-Ins_Queries"

"05-Ins_TypeDefs-Resolvers"

"11-Ins_MERN-Setup"

"17-Ins_useMutation"

"17-Ins_useMutation"

"19-Ins_MERN-Review"

"28-Stu_Mini-Project"

After this, I searched the internet for further information and came across the following websites as references:

"https://github.com/dneflas/MERN-book-search-engine"

"https://github.com/Lemming97/Book-Search-Engine"

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and websites mentioned above and commenting out every section of code in all of the files to see what each specific block of code accomplished as I was structuring/working on the app in a similar manner to the Model-View-Controller format from Module 14, starting with the Back End Server folders and then following it with the Front End Client folders. 

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Accepted Criteria as possible.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given inside the above referenced websites was very helpful, simply copying and pasting code without understanding what that code does will lead to more complications and a lack of understanding.
