Module 21 MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

## Introduction

For this assignment, I attempted to refactor a functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API into one featuring GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.  This app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## Criteria
To meet the Accepted Criteria of this assignment, I tried to accomplish as much of the following as I could:

When the user loads the search engine, they are presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup as well as an input field to search for books and a submit button.

When the user clicks on the Search for Books menu option, they are presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button.

When the user is not logged in and enters a search term in the input field and click the submit button, they are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

When the user clicks on the Login/Signup menu option, a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up.

When the toggle is set to Signup, the user is presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, along with a signup button.

When the toggle is set to Login, the user is presented with two inputs for an email address and a password along with a login button.

When the user enters a valid email address and creates a password and clicks on the signup button, their user account is created and they are logged in to the site.

When the user enters their account’s email address and password and click on the login butto, the modal closes and they are logged in to the site.

When the user is logged in to the site, the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see saved books, and Logout.

When the user is logged in and enters a search term in the input field and clicks the submit button, they are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to their account.

When the user clicks on the Save button on a book, that book’s information is saved to their account.

When the user clicks on the option to see their saved books, they are presented with all of the books they have saved to their account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from their account.

When the user clicks on the Remove button on a book, that book is deleted from their saved books list.

When the user clicks on the Logout button, they are logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.  

## References

To complete this assignment I studied the following activities from the Module 21-MERN Class Activity Files as references:

"01-Ins_Apollo-Server"

"03-Ins_Queries"

"05-Ins_TypeDefs-Resolvers"

"11-Ins_MERN-Setup"

"17-Ins_useMutation"

"17-Ins_useMutation"

"19-Ins_MERN-Review"

"28-Stu_Mini-Project"

After this, I searched the internet for further information and came across the following websites as references:

"https://github.com/dneflas/MERN-book-search-engine"

"https://github.com/Lemming97/Book-Search-Engine"

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and websites mentioned above and commenting out every section of code in all of the files to see what each specific block of code accomplished as I was structuring/working on the app in a similar manner to the Model-View-Controller format from Module 14, starting with the Back End Server folders and then following it with the Front End Client folders. 

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Accepted Criteria as possible.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given inside the above referenced websites was very helpful, simply copying and pasting code without understanding what that code does will lead to more complications and a lack of understanding.
